# The basic idea

Halfmoon Organic is a small vegetable farm in Port Matilda Pennsylvania. At this stage, it is an idea more than anything but that will soon change. 

Our core objectives are:
1) Grow organic vegetables in a sustainable way for the enjoyment of our family, friends and community
2) Minimize environmental impact in general and reduce plastic pollution in particular
3) Achieve superior results through technology, artificial intelligence and open source software
